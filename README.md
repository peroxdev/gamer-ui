I made this project so that others could learn how to make a Synapse X custom UI using WinForms. I've seen a lot of people who are clueless on how to do it, so this should serve as a good example. I myself am not very experienced in C# (I wrote the original version of this UI in a night!), so the code should be intelligible for other beginners.  

### features

  * Monaco Editor with custom Synapse global highlighting and intellisense
  * Synapse X WebSocket API Interoperability
  * Script Hub
  * Automatically add custom globals on inject

### dependencies

  * SXLib
  * Monaco files (can be found in binary releases)
