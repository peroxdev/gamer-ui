I made this project so that others could learn how to make a Synapse X custom UI using WinForms. I've seen a lot of people who are clueless on how to do it, so this should serve as a good example. I myself am not very experienced in C#, so the code might not be the best.

### Features
  * Monaco Editor with custom Synapse global highlighting and intellisense
  * Synapse X WebSocket API Interoperability
  * Script Hub
  * Automatically add custom globals on inject

### To-do
  * Local HTTP server for relaying information across Gamer UI and Roblox
  * Finish WebSocket API (interop. and add other services)
  * Themes

### Dependencies
  * SXLib
  * CefSharp
  * Monaco files (can be found in releases)
  * [Syncfusion Enterprise Studio for WinForms](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense)
