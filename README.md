open source bc i've seen too many shitty uis with even shittier practices

i learned c# in a night making the original version of this, it shouldn't be that hard.

not working yet, things to do:

*  actually add syn api stuff
*  websockets
*  local http api for interfacing and Such

### dependencies

*  sxlib (obviously)
*  monaco files (will be included in binary releases when they happen)
*  bunifu ui
