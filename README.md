## super epic gamer ui!!!

open source bc i've seen too many shitty uis with even shittier practices

i learned c# in a night making the original version of this, it shouldn't be that hard.

not working yet, things to do:

* actually add syn api stuff
* websockets
* local http api for interfacing and Such

### dependencies:

* sxlib (obviously)
* monaco files (will be included in binary releases when they happen)
* bunifu ui
